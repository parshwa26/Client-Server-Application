# Client-Server-Application
 
There are two programs in C, a client and a server, to implement a simple text file transfer application.
The server process and the client process will run on two different machines and the communication between the two processes is achieved using sockets.
Client can request server to download or upload the files.
Server serves the request to the client and displays appropriate message on successful operations.
